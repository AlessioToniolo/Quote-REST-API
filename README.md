# Quote REST API

## Welcome
This is a REST API, specifically for popular quotes, that I built as a learning practice.
It allows for all CRUD operations and uses a simple JSON data store for these quotes.
By making a get, post, put, and delete request to the api endpoint, you can manipulate and view
the datastore of quotes.

## Getting Started
To use this API, you can simply clone the repository, `npm install` to install all project
dependencies,
and then start up a local server with `npm start`.

## About
The project is fully backend, written in JavaScript. It uses Node.js to be backend, and
utilizes the [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) library for all routing and functionality.
I tested the routes using the Postman software. In the datastore are some random inspirational quotes.
In addition, there is a random api endpoint for retreiving a random quote out of the data store.

### Side Note
The project uses Node.js and NPM (which comes packaged with Node), so you must have Node.js installed on
your computer. The Node modules are ignored in git, so that is why there are not visible on the repository.
