# Quote REST API

## Welcome
This is a REST API, specifically for popular quotes, that I built as a learning practice.
It allows for all CRUD operations and uses a simple JSON data store for these quotes.
By making a get, post, put, and delete request to the api endpoint, you can manipulate and view
the datastore of quotes.

## Getting Started
To use this API, you can simply clone the repository, `npm install` to install all project
dependencies, and then start up a local server with `npm start`.

## About
The project is fully backend, written in JavaScript. It uses node.js to be backend, and
utilizes the [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) library for all routing and functionality.
I tested the routes using the Postman software. In the datastore are some random inspirational quotes.
In addition, there is a random api endpoint for retreiving a random quote out of the data store.
